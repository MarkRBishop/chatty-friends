## Description

This appliciation is an API for a social media page that allows users to be created, make posts called thoughts, add other users to a friends list and allow for reactions from others to be made on the thoughts.

## Getting started 

You'll need to navigate to the desired folder and clone a copy of the repository into the folder.

Once you have the repository set up, you need only run the command to install dependencies
```
npm i
```

next, you'll start the application
```
npm run start
```

Afterwards you can navigate to an application like insomnia and you can start creating users as well as create posts, add reactions, edit friends lists if necessary

There is a link at the top of this README with a video showing some of the functions you can use. (I must appologize i made a typo when demonstrating the last funciton, deleting a reaction. I did however show that it does work later so bear with me on that last part of the clip.)
